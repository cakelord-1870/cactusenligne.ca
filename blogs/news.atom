    <title>Why is my cactus turning brown?</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><em>Note to reader: this article applies to desert cacti, not jungle cacti.</em></p>
<p>Your cactus is turning brown and you don't know what's causing it? Don't be discouraged! It’s an opportunity to explore and learn more.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0014/9789/0903/files/brown_cereus_240x240.jpg?v=1624715982" alt="Browning cactus base." style="margin-right: 5px; float: left;" width="240x240" height="240x240">For all plants, indoor or outdoor, the appearance of visible browning often indicates a disorder which can be biotic (diseases, insects) or abiotic (temperature, watering, injury, etc.). In order to properly identify the source of the problem, put yourself in detective mode, ask yourself a few questions and observe.<br><br>
</div>
<p>How often do you water? Desert cacti prefer dryness between watering and if you don't allow this break, you run the risk of root rot, which results in a brownish discoloration at the base of the stem. To avoid this problem for indoor cacti, let the soil dry at least between 4 to 5 cm before watering again. When the time comes, if you can transport your plant easily, water by capillary – that is, water from the bottom. Assuming it has holes, dip the pot in about 4 cm of water until the soil is nicely soaked. Desert cacti prefer occasional heavy watering rather than frequent light watering.</p>
<p>What time of year is it? Ah, this is an important question, as desert cacti require more water in the summer and very little, if any, in the winter. You have to adapt to the season, the temperature in the room, and the exposure to light. Also, be aware that a drastic increase in sun exposure can also cause browning. This should be avoided.</p>
<p>Which potting soil did you use? Black spots on a cactus can indicate excess moisture or poor drainage, both of which are very important for desert cacti and can be avoided by using specialized potting soils for cacti. When in doubt, with good gloves, take the plant out of its pot, observe the moisture content of the potting soil and its composition, and change the potting soil if necessary.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0014/9789/0903/files/prickly_pear_brown_spot_B_240x240.jpg?v=1624718490" alt="" style="float: right;" width="289" height="304"></div>
<p>Has the plant been damaged by a physical injury (by a tool, by a fall, human mishandling or a prick from a nearby cactus)? In this case, it is most likely that the damage has caused browning. You can remove the affected part or allow it to scar.</p>
<p>Other causes can explain the appearance of brown or black spots, such as poor  aeration or a fungal disease. Sometimes, it is simply the normal aging of the plant that is responsible. This is the phenomenon of lignification.</p>
<p>The proper care of a cactus is inherent to its genus and species. It is therefore always best to learn about the specifics of your cactus by researching its Latin name. You will find great satisfaction in deepening your knowledge and feeling that you are giving the right care to the designated plant.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>The mealy bug, or scale insect, is one of the most common (and annoying) parasites found on houseplants. For the mealybug, landing a plant is a real all-you-can-eat buffet! They’ll on the sap of leaves until the plant is dead. It’s important to treat a plant immediately once we spot a mealybug. Isolate the affected plant to prevent the mealybugs from spreading to other plants.</p>
<p><strong><span>How to recognize scale insect?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The mealybug is cottony and oval in appearance and is usually hidden on the back of the leaves. As for cacti, they are generally found between the spines. The harmfulness of scale insects comes from their impressive reproductive capacity, a single female can lay a thousand eggs!</span></p>
<p><span>The scale insect can sometimes be difficult to recognize on the cactus, as many of them naturally form wool. If you are unsure, spray the cactus with water and vinegar. If the wool disappears, it means it is from mealybugs. If the wool stays, it means it's part of the cactus!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are several ways to get rid of mealybugs. Here are two simple and easy ways: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>The first</span></strong><span> and simplest, is to spray each mealybug with a mixture of water and vinegar. Vinegar can also be replaced with black soap. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>The second</span></strong><span> is to soak a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol and to tap it on the scale. This quick and simple method will burn the scale, without hurting the plant. </span></p>
<p><span>Whichever treatment you choose, it is recommended that you repeat the movement on all areas with scale insects for 5 days.</span></p>
<p><span>In spite of the treatment, it is possible that this parasite will resurface. When it is noticed, the plant must be treated immediately.  However, if your plant is severely affected by scale insects, it is preferable to get rid of it or cut off the hard affected branches. </span></p>]]>

<p>As the name suggests, this adorable hybrid succulent grows small dolphin shaped leaves along its trailing stems. Not only is this Senecio a quick grower, it is also very easy to propagate. It's as simple as planting a stem in soil and spraying it with water. Once the plant has rooted up, you can water only when the soil is dry. To get the fastest growth, this plant enjoys a bit of bright sunlight!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>It doesn't matter whether you're in the heart of the city or out in the countryside, your outdoor plants will be covered in snow. Fortunately for us, we can bring a bit of this green inside to help us make it through the cold season. It is possible to green up your home with a few simple tips to make winter more plant friendly. </p>
<p>If you're low on light during the winter or summer isn't long enough to get the vegetable harvest you've always wanted, this article is for you!</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong><br>With shorter winter days, indoor plants are getting less and less light. It is important to pay attention to your lighting conditions by placing your plants in the brightest part of your home or by supplementing with a Sunblaster LED light. You can simply place the Sunblaster above your plants and give them some extra light during the daytime, around 12 hours a day. It's as easy as that!</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cuttings coming to life</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In addition to good lighting, your plant cuttings will appreciate a bit of heat. To speed up the growing process, a heated pad is ideal. They are conveniently made with small growing holes that are perfect for placing your seeds and cuttings.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Last but not least: Watering!<br></strong>With an LED light and a heating pad, the soil will dry out quickly. This may sound like a bad thing, but it is perfect for preventing root rot! Always make sure to check if the soil is completely dry before watering your cacti and succulents. You can check with your finger if there is any humidity left in the soil or simply use a hygrometer. If the soil is dry, it's time to water!</div>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ça y est, l’hiver est bel et bien arrivé! En fait, nous sommes toujours en automne, mais avec la bordée de neige qu'il y a eu cette semaine et les stations de ski qui ouvrent, on peut vraiment dire que c'est le temps des fêtes qui commence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">À l’approche des fêtes, nous vous avons préparé une sélection de plantes qui n’ont rien à envier au sapin! Vous pourrez rendre vos proches heureux en leur offrant un cadeau, ou simplement ajouter une touche d’originalité à votre maison cet hiver.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cactusenligne.ca/products/aloe-christmas-carol-4?_pos=5&amp;_sid=536c487ec&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Aloe Christmas Carol</strong></a> </span>🎊</p>
<p>Comme son nom l'indique, l'Aloe Christmas Carol est LA succulente qui orne les couleurs de Noël, avec sa ligne rouge et ses feuilles vertes. Si vous avez un proche qui n'a pas le pouce vert, cette plante est le cadeau parfait! En effet, l'aloès tolère bien les oublis d'eau, et s'adapte aux différentes luminosité (bien qu'elle préfère le soleil indirect). Elle est aussi plus rare que l'Aloes Vera et l'Aloes Arborescens, ce qui ne manquera pas d'attirer les regards (ou c'est peut-être du à ses couleurs vives!). </p>

<p>Avec ses épines et ses pigments blancs, l'Opuntia rehausse n'importe quelle pièce ensoleillée. Avec les années, ce petit cactus atteindra jusqu'à 3 mètres! Il rattrapera peut-être même votre sapin de Noël ;) Si vous l'offrez en cadeau, choisissez-lui une belle tasse qui saura le mettre en valeur! </p>

<p>À la recherche d'un sapin revisité? Le Pencil Cactus se distingue par son originalité, et sa solidité! Croyez-le ou non, nous l'utilisons pour accrocher des boules de Noël à la boutique. Cette plante a aussi l'avantage de grandir rapidement, jusqu'à atteindre 30 pieds de haut. Oui oui, 30 pieds! Ce cactus est toutefois facile à tailler s'il devient trop grand. </p>

<p>Avec sa tête rouge, le Red Moon Cactus arbore on ne peut mieux les couleurs de Noël. La bonne nouvelle est qu'il restera rouge toute l'année, et vous offrira peut-être même une fleur. Pour maximiser les chances de floraison, placez-le au soleil direct cet hiver, et minimisez les arrosages (puisqu'il hiberne).</p>

<p>En plus de demander peu d'entretien, le Kalanchoe Tomentosa est une plante qui se distingue par son look hivernal en raison de ses feuilles couvertes de velour blanc comme neige. Adoptez-la en hiver afin d'être aux premières loges de sa floraison lorsqu'arrivera la saison estivale (On a déjà hâte!). Dans le jargon, on l'appelle également la plante panda.</p>

<p><strong>Cactus de Noël </strong>🌺</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roulement de tambours! Le cactus qui est le plus en vogue durant le Temps des fêtes est non le moindre le cactus de Noël. Tu l'as déjà surement vue sur la table de ta tante durant son festin des Fêtes ou bien encore ta grand-mère l'a probablement déjà offert comme cadeau de bienvenue à tes parents. Ce classique incontournable porte un tel nom, puisqu'il fleurit seulement durant le mois de décembre. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Our team of cactus experts have compiled some of our best tips to help you keep your cacti happy all year round!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Summer</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>Light</strong><span> </span>– Place your cactus in a bright, sunny spot. It should ideally have at least a few hours of direct sunlight a day.</p>
<p><strong>Watering</strong><span> </span>– Let the soil dry out completely before giving the cactus a good soak. It depends how much sun your cactus is getting, but every two weeks is a good general rule.</p>
<p><strong>Soil</strong><span> </span>– If you are changing the soil of your cactus, make sure to use cactus soil! This allows for the water to properly drain and for the soil to dry quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Fertilizing</strong><span> </span>– Mixing a cactus fertilizer into your watering once a month can help your cactus grow beautifully</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">

<meta content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>Light</strong><span> </span>– Try and keep your cactus in a bright spot during winter, but don’t stress if there is less sun than in summer. Your cactus will be in a resting period.</p>
<p><strong>Watering</strong><span> </span>–Cacti are in a resting period during the winter and prefer to stay quite dry. Reduce watering frequency to once a month depending on the sun and allow your cactus to dry as quick as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Soil</strong><span> </span>– If you are changing the soil of your cactus, make sure to use cactus soil! This allows for the water to properly drain and for the soil to dry quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Fertilizing</strong><span> </span>– Cacti are in a resting period during winter, it’s best to wait until spring to start fertilizing.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Quick Tips</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The best time to water is in the morning on a sunny day!</p>
<p><strong>Less sun = Less frequent watering.</strong><span> </span>If you are keeping your cactus in a lower-light area, you can water even less often.</p>
<p><strong>Colder temperatures = Less frequent watering.</strong><span> </span>When temperatures are colder, the soil takes longer to completely dry out.</p>
<p>If your pot doesn’t have a drainage hole, use 1/3 of the volume of the pot when watering.</p>
<p>The bigger your cactus, the less often it needs to be watered. A big cactus holds a lot of water inside of it. Unless it is very hot and sunny, an 8” pot only needs water every 6 weeks.</p>

<h3>As-tu un cactus chez toi qui pousse vraiment lentement?</h3>
<p>Si c'est le cas, c'est qu'il ne reçoit pas assez de soleil. Un cactus à besoin d'une grande charge de soleil pour pousser. Place-le dans un endroit très lumineux et il commencera à pousser très rapidement.</p>
<h3>Quelle est la quantité d'eau à donner à un cactus?</h3>
<p>Un cactus n'a pas besoin de beaucoup d'eau pour vivre. Il faut toujours se mettre en contexte que les cactus poussent dans le désert, là où l'eau est quasi introuvable. En été, quelques gouttes d'eau suffirent par semaine. En hiver, le cactus entre en hibernation. Il faut alors lui donner de l'eau une à deux fois maximum durant cette période. En résumé, pour garder ton cactus en santé, arrose-le une fois par semaine en été et seulement une fois durant l'hiver.</p>
<h3>Comment multiplier son cactus en plusieurs autres?</h3>
<p>C'est très facile! Un cactus créé lui-même d'autres cactus qui lui poussent sur le corps. Prenons par exemple la photo ci-dessous. Le cactus à généré 2 autres cactus. </p>

<p>Vous êtes plusieurs à nous écrire pour savoir si vos cactus/succulentes sont toxiques pour votre petit chat ou chien. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé d'écrire ce petit guide pratique!</p>
<p>Premièrement, rassure-toi. La grande majorité des cactus ne sont pas toxiques. Si tu as un animal de compagnie à la maison et qu'il a tendance à manger tes plantes, voici les variétés de cactus à éviter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Euphorbe</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Les plantes du genre Euphorbe produisent un latex très irritant pour les yeux et la peau. Il faut essayer d'éviter tout contact, même pour les humains. Si jamais ton animal mange l'Euphorbe, essaie de lui faire boire le plus d'eau possible pour faire diluer le latex. Ensuite, nous te suggérons d'appeler un vétérinaire. </p>

<p>La cochenille farineuse, également appelée ''<em>mealybug</em>'' est l'un des parasites que l'on retrouve le plus fréquemment sur les plantes d'intérieur. Pour ce parasite, avoir trouvé une plante est un vrai buffet à volonté. La cochenille se nourrit de la sève des feuilles jusqu'à la mort de la plante. Lorsqu'on en aperçoit sur l'une de nos plantes, il faut tout de suite la traiter, pour éviter qu'elle meurt ou bien qu'elle se multiplie. Nous recommandons également d'isoler la plante atteinte pour éviter la propagation sur les autres plantes de la maison.</p>
<h3>Comment reconnaitre la cochenille?</h3>
<p>Ayant un aspect cotonneux et ovale, la cochenille se dissimule généralement à l'endos des feuilles. Pour ce qui est des cactus, on les retrouvent généralement entre les épines. La nuisibilité des cochenilles vient de leur capacité reproductrice impressionnante, une seule femelle pouvant pondre un millier d’œufs!</p>
<p>La cochenille peut parfois être difficile à reconnaitre sur le cactus, car plusieurs d'entre eux forment naturellement de la laine. Si vous être dans une incertitude, vaporisez le cactus avec de l'eau et du vinaigre. Si la laine disparait, ça voudra dire que c'était des<span> </span><em>mealybugs</em>. Si la laine reste et bien cela voudra dire que ça fait partie du cactus!</p>

<h3>Le traitement</h3>
<p>Il existe plusieurs façons pour se débarrasser des<span> </span><em>mealybugs.</em> En voici deux très faciles à faire. </p>
<p><strong>La première</strong><span> </span>et la plus simple, est de vaporiser chaque cochenille avec un mélange d'eau et de vinaigre. Le vinaigre peut également être remplacé par du savon noir. </p>
<p><strong>La deuxième</strong><span> </span>consiste à imbiber un Q-tips d'alcool à friction et de le tapoter sur la cochenille. Cette méthode rapide et simple brûlera la cochenille, sans faire mal à la plante. </p>
<p>Peu importe le traitement que vous choisissez, il est recommandé de répéter le mouvement à tous les endroits ayant des cochenilles durant 5 jours.</p>
<p>Malgré le traitement, il arrive que ce parasite refasse surface. Lorsqu'on en aperçoit, il faut immédiatement traiter la plante.  Si toutefois arrivait que votre plante soit sévèrement atteinte de cochenille, il est préférable de s'en départir ou bien de couper les branches durement atteintes. </p>
